# Examples
This repository is made up of several different submodule repositories, each of which is an example project that will give you some idea of my coding abilities.

## How To Use This Repository
Each of the repositories in the list below can be explored further via this repository's folder structure. Or to access the originals, please click on the hyperlinks.

- #### [BaseballDatabase](https://github.com/pmelgren/BaseballDatabase)
    Baseball Database contains various batch files and SQL scripts to import publicly-available baseball play by play data into a PostgreSQL database. This repo will give you and idea of my SQL and data warehousing skills.

- #### [gameTracker](https://github.com/pmelgren/gameTracker)
    gameTracker is an app built using R Shiny to watch rugby games and record the events in real-time. This repo shows off some of my front-end experience. This is by far the largest project in this repo and will also give you an idea of my ability to build out a large data project and put it into production. 

- #### [clautoscraper](https://github.com/pmelgren/clautoscraper)
    The Craigslist Autos Scraper shows off a very simplified version of my ability to build a scraper using Python. This script is also structured as a Python module and demonstrates my ability to build reusable, production-level python code. 

- #### [Hive_to_FWF](https://github.com/pmelgren/Hive_to_FWF)
    Hive_to_FWF is an anonymized and simplified version of my first freelancing contract that required me to query data from a Hive database and save it as a fixed-width file. This repo shows off some basic ETL abilities.

- #### [NCAABasketball](https://github.com/pmelgren/NCAABasketball)
    NCAABasketball is an anonymized version of another freelancing contract where I was asked to mine and analyze NCAA basketball information.

Most of these projects are just a small taste of what I can offer. Unfortunately, my best work is usually NDA protected. But I still think there is more than enough here to give you an idea of what I am capable of. Thanks for having a look!
